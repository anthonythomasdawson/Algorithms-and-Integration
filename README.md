# Algorithms-and-Integration
Program to integrate a function using different methods

This programme will numerically integrate the following 

$$ f(x) = {x}^3 - {3x}^2 -2x +190$$

With the solution of:

$$\int_{-2}^2 f(x) \,dx= 744$$

Using a number of different methods

The programme will then simulate a game of craps using similar methods to part 4
